              <p>
                508.dev's globally distributed nature means we are uniquely positioned to assist
                with localization, particularly to Taiwan and China, but as well as Latin America,
                portions of Africa, Italy, and Eastern Europe. All of our members that can work
                in localization are at minimum expertly proficient in English, as a prerequisite
                to co-op membership. No more miscommunication with localization staff!

              <p>
                Since nearly every member of 508.dev is bi- or tri-lingual (or more!), we
                would essentially
                need to just re-list everyone here. Instead, take a look at our
